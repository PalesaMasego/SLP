        <div class="col">Welcome to my future, walk with me... I see myself as working homewife...I know it doesn't make sense but as I asked, kindly walk with me...<br><br>Yes, homewife as I would like to have a home and not a house. A home is warm and filled with love and all the good things but a house gives off coldness, it is afterall brick and mortar... so, that is where I come in to make it warm.<br><br>I was stuck or rather decided against usings the word "dreams" as I felt that "dreams" have some sort of conotation that it will be just that a dream. So with aspiations, I will have that..it will come to pass you know... allow me to be bit religious "Habakkuk 2:2-3". <br><br> Back to the working homewife part, by that I mean I see myself as a homemaker, right...that wife and mom who loves baking and making hearty food for my family of 3/4/5. That is the end goal, to have a close knit family and wholesome family. I believe in family so much, happy and healthy family that is.<br><br> Sure, that my aspirations, however I would still like to contribute to the household finanacially even if it is 10% right lol, so attain my own personal goals is also a thing for me that fulfills me. Oh yes, one of my love languages is acts of services and my partner as well...<br><br>Let us hold it right there...I will come back soon with an update...</div>
