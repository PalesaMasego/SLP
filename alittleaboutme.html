I love love cars and fast cars at that, as you can see the card image is an Audi S3, okay let me go into more detail and 2020 Audi S3 Nardo grey sedan... that sounds slightly better!! <br><br> I would love to own one and hopefully on my next birthday it will be in my garage...that's the plan.<br><br> Back to me, an interest fact?? I have brown belt in Shotokan Karate...haha. <br><br> Okay that's it...I have shared a lot about me, for now. Ohh yes, yes I AM A BLACK FEMALE IT/ CLOUD ENGINEER and ASPIRING SOFTWARE ENGINEER...<br><br> Oh you are probably wondering why the opening image is a flower..."Palesa", my name means flowerLet me know what else you would love to learn about me...</div>
